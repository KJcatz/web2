It all starts with Merida discovering "the-will-of-the-wisps" (magic). The Magic turns her mother into a bear. This magic is why animals and inanimate objects (brooms & tools) behave like humans. Magic was utilized by a witch, who mysteriously vanishes through wooden doors.

Eventually the Magic from the will of the wisps would lead to the birth of super heroes

        Superheroes maintained order in the world. But Buddy, a wannabe superhero, created two things for the demise of superpowered humans: self serving A.I. bots like the "Omnidroid," and the high tech Zero Point Energy (electromagnetic energy that exists in a vacuum). This is the pivotal moment where we see machines eradicating their only threatâˆ’supers.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, toys start to absorb and draw their powers from Zero Point Energy, unseen energy that travels in wavelengths.
