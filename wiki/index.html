        Bob's Burgers is an American animated sitcom created by Loren Bouchard for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Belchers—parents Bob and Linda, and their children Tina, Gene, and Louise—who run a hamburger restaurant. The family was conceived by Bouchard after he developed Home Movies.
Since its debut on January 9, 2011, the series has broadcast 91 episodes. While reviews for the first season were mixed, feedback for subsequent seasons has been very positive. After the first season, Bento Box Entertainment was replaced[citation needed] by Wilo Productions and Buck & Millie Productions. All seasons are produced and distributed in association with 20th Century Fox Television and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The series premiere, "Human Flesh", drew in 9.38 million viewers, making it the highest-rated series premiere of the season and also finished 9th in the ratings for the week it aired.[2][3] Reruns began airing on Cartoon Network's late night adult programming block Adult Swim on June 23, 2013,[4] and began airing in syndication on local stations in September 2015.
A comic book series based on the show, published by Dynamite Entertainment, began in September 2014,[5] and a soundtrack album is planned to be released at some point.[6][7]In 2013, TV Guide ranked Bob's Burgers as one of the top 60 Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time.[8] The series has been nominated for several awards, including the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2012 and 2013, before it won the award in 2014.
